# **Geometric Algorithms**.  

## **Repository for the course Geometric Algorithms at AGH**.

In this repository I solve the assignments from labs 1-4 in the Geometric Algorithms course. The notebook diagrams and the visualization tool were prepared by **Bit Scientific Circle**. They can be found at: [https://github.com/aghbit/Algorytmy-Geometryczne](#).  

### **List of labs**.  

| Lab | Topic |.
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| **Lab 1** | Geometric predicates.                 
| **Lab 2** | Convex hull- Graham and Jarvis algorithms.
| Lab 3** | Triangulation of a monotone polygon.
| Lab 4** | Intersections of segments - the sweep algorithm.
